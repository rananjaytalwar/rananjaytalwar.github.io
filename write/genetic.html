            <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
            <p id="written-text">
                The discovery of the structure and function of DNA in the 1950’s was a monumental event in the history of humanity. It was naturally followed by
                the question of our ability to change it. This resulted in a number of experiments, around the early 1970’s, in which it was shown that DNA could
                be collected from different sources and deliberately recombined. It became clear that it was possible to make genetic patterns that were different
                from those found in nature.

            </p>
            <p id="written-text">
                This “recombinant DNA” gave rise to the field of genetic engineering. There were plenty of opportunities to put this technology to practical use
                and the industry of “biotechnology” formed around this.
            </p>
            <p id="written text">
                It was not long after this, that a human gene, somatostatin, was spliced into the bacteria E. coli.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/412251"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p id="written text">
                The era of ‘synthetic biology’ had arrived. The ambition for the field included not only describing and analysing existing genes in nature, but also
                constructing new genetic patterns through re-arrangement.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/744485">
                    <sup>[2]</sup>
                </a> In fact, the early ideas of re-arrangement had been superseded by the ideas of
                <i>de novo</i> design and “programming” of genes, and therefore, life itself.
            </p>
            <p id="written text">
                It is hard to imagine higher stakes than this. The development of synthetic biology is faced with interest from all spheres of society.
                A point of influence in the field is the interplay of the ethos of open science and intellectual property law. Another important aspect of the
                field is the regulation that surrounds it.
            </p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p><b>Current state of regulation in the field</b></p>
            <p id="written text">
                In 2016, the CRISPR patent dispute in the United States, clearly brought forth the issue of intellectual property in the field. The dispute,
                which is ongoing currently, between the Broad Institute and University of California, Berkeley, has had major ramifications for the bio-technology
                industry.<a href="https://cen.acs.org/policy/litigation/Broad-prevails-over-Berkeley-CRISPR/96/web/2018/09"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p id="written text">
                In 2018, reports came out about the gene editing experiments conducted on human babies by researchers in the People’s Republic of China.
                They claimed to have created “the first genetically modified human babies”. This sent shockwaves throughout the world, and put the question
                of regulation of the field at the forefront.
            </p>
            <p id="written text">
                There is a difference of opinions among researchers regarding the adequate level of concern and the capabilities of the technology.
                OvaScience, a company based in the United States, argues that this technology will allow parents to choose not only “when and how they have
                children [but also] how healthy those children are going to be”. David Sinclair, a geneticist at Harvard University and a co-founder of OvaScience,
                stated at a presentation that “there is no reason to expect” that the ability to remove defective genes, referring to those in genetic diseases,
                “won’t be possible in coming years.”<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2015/03/05/249167/engineering-the-perfect-baby/"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p id="written text">
                It is easy to understand the concerns surrounding the field, especially on the topic of extreme scenarios.<a href="https://business.financialpost.com/executive/smart-shift/from-curing-diseases-to-making-designer-babies-human-gene-editing-is-coming"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p id="written text">
                However, some researchers state that the capabilities of the technology, currently, do not extend as far as people are touting it to be.
                Dr. Stuart Kim, a genetics professor at Stanford University, argues that the notion of making an individual faster or more resilient is
                “still far enough off, [that it] might as well be the stuff of science fiction”.<a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2045666/could-crispr-genetically-tailor-athletes-its-nice-idea">
                    <sup>[6]</sup>
                </a> Similarly, Rudolf Janeisch, a biologist at the Massachusetts
                Institute of Technology, stated that any “attempts to edit human embryos [are] totally premature”.
            </p>
            <p id="written text">
                The focus of the technology is, for the most part, on single-gene disorders, whereas traits such as increasing resistance to muscular injury for example,
                involve multiple genes. In order to make modifications on the level of these traits, it would first need to be understood how these genes interact.
                However, the difference of opinion among researchers illustrates the uncertainty about the current and near future capabilities.
            </p>
            <p id="written text">
                It is prudent, given the profound consequences, to address the regulatory and ethical issues through a global discussion. Internationally,
                the countries of the People’s Republic of China, the United States, and the United Kingdom are at the forefront of genetic engineering.
                It is useful to look at the regulations in place in these jurisdictions, since it is likely that other countries will also look to their actions.
            </p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p><b>People's Republic of China</b></p>
            <p id="written text">
                In theory, there is an outright legislative ban on gene editing of human embryos in China.<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-countries-allow-researchers-to-edit-human-embryos-2015-10?IR=T">
                    <sup>[7]</sup>
                </a> However, China’s stem cell research is often
                referred to as “wild” and it being “one of the most unrestrictive regulatory regimes”.<a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2015-08/21/content_21662613.htm">
                    <sup>[8]</sup>
                </a>
            </p>
            <p id="written text">
                The problem is the lack of enforcement of the regulations, and the loopholes in them. The Chinese researchers recently used one such
                loophole to edit the genes of human babies for the first time in history.<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/chinese-researcher-says-he-proud-gene-editing-twins-n941201"><sup>[9]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p id="written text">
                The Guidelines for Ethical Principles in Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research, a 2003 joint issuance from the Ministry of Science and Technology,
                covers this field of research. The National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC), in charge of guidance and formation of scientific
                programs related to health and family planning, and the Chinese Food and Drug Administration (CFDA), which regulates genetic testing,
                are other agencies that could also be involved in such a scenario.
            </p>
            <p id="written text">
                The guidelines dictate a ban on “using human egg plasma and nuclear transfer technology for the purposes of reproduction, and the manipulation
                of the genes in human gametes, zygotes or embryos for the purposes of reproduction”. However, the guidelines permit research using embryonic
                stem cells from specified sources, such as unwanted embryos from IVF, miscarriages, voluntarily induced abortions, and donated germ cells.
            </p>
            <p id="written text">
                It is important to note that the ban allows clinical applications of gene sequencing to continue if they are approved by the NHFPC and are done
                according to regulations. The ban actually mostly consists of guidelines, which are considered “soft laws”. This might also make the use of sanctions,
                as a control mechanism, ambiguous or unenforceable.<a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/science/tweaking-the-genes-in-human-embryos-is-technically-legal-in-many-countries-and-a-new-experiment-could-open-up-the-floodgates/articleshow/47032030.cms"><sup>[10]</sup></a>

            <p><b>United States</b></p>
            <p id="written text">
                The National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States issued a statement, after the news of the Chinese researchers’ experiments on human babies,
                that it would "not fund any use of gene-editing technologies in human embryos."<a href="https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/who-we-are/nih-director/statements/statement-nih-funding-research-using-gene-editing-technologies-human-embryos">
                    <sup>[11]</sup>
                </a> The NIH states that “it is a line that should not be crossed” and
                that “there are multiple existing legislative and regulatory prohibitions” to that effect.
            </p>
            <p id="written text">
                The Dickey-Wicker amendment prohibits the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from using any appropriated funds for both, "the creation
                of a human embryo or embryos for research purposes", and "research in which human embryos are destroyed, discarded, or knowingly subjected to risk
                of injury or death greater than that allowed for research on foetuses in utero" according to the applicable federal law.
            </p>
            <p id="written text">
                There are indications, however, that the United States might remove some of these restrictions. David Magnus, the Director of the Stanford Centre
                for Biomedical Ethics, and Nicole Martinez, a lecturer and fellow at Stanford University, have criticized the United States regulatory control of
                gene editing "as a 'wild west' of reproductive technology."<a href="https://time.com/4204059/crispr-regulation/">

            <p id="written text">
                One of the concerns is, that there is no government authority that regulates privately funded projects. Therefore, it is not illegal to
                implant a genetically modified embryo to begin a pregnancy. Moreover, owing to the separation of powers between the states and the federal
                government, states such as California are considering funding research on gene editing of human embryos as per their own laws.
            </p>

            <p><b>United Kingdom</b></p>
            <p id="written text">
                England was the first country to have a test-tube baby. It was also the first to use pre-implantation genetic diagnostics, and to clone a higher
                vertebrate. It has been a leader "in human embryonic stem cell derivation and banking."<a href="https://jstor.org/stable/j.ctt4cgd33"><sup>[13]</sup></a>
                The United Kingdom is always at the forefront of any discussion on reproductive medicine.
            </p>
            <p id="written text">
                The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act governs the Human Fertilisation & Embryology Authority (HFEA). It is responsible for regulation of all
                research involving human embryos. The Act imposes an outright ban on the use of modified embryos for pregnancy. It only permits implantation of an
                embryo if "no nuclear or mitochondrial DNA of any cell of the embryos has been altered and no cell has been added to it other than by division of the
                embryo's own cells."<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/22/section/3"><sup>[14]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p id="written text">
                There is, however, a point of interest, which is the licensing system. In February 2016, there was a research license granted that allows for the
                keeping, use, and storage of embryos for a period of three years, with the option of renewal. This was used to genetically edit human embryos.
                The embryos were donated by a couple, from their surplus after IVF treatments, since the researchers could not have implanted it as per
                regulations.<a href="https://www.nature.com/news/uk-scientists-gain-licence-to-edit-genes-in-human-embryos-1.19270">
                    <sup>[15]</sup>
                </a> The license notes that these activities are for the purpose of "developing treatments for serious disease or other serious medical
                conditions," "increasing knowledge about the development of embryos," and "promoting advances in the treatment of infertility."<a href="https://ifqlive.blob.core.windows.net/inspectiondocuments/5768.pdf"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p id="written text">
                This license can be seen as the first global endorsement for such research by a national regulatory authority, and as a precedent for the future.
                The HFEA committee did reiterate that the research project cannot involve placing non- permitted embryos, eggs, or sperm in a woman, or keeping
                or using embryos after fourteen days from the date of creation or upon the appearance of a primitive streak. It also stressed that no gene editing
                research can take place without an ethics approval.
            </p>

            <p><b>Final remarks</b></p>
            <p id="written text">
                The field of genetic engineering affects global concerns such as medicine, law and trade. Moreover, as a matter of financial opportunities or prestige,
                in the race to make the breakthroughs first, few countries are willing to adopt binding measures. UNESCO’s Universal Declaration on Bioethics and
                Human Rights is an illustration of this.
            </p>
            <p id="written text">
                It is true that early success shows the promise of this field. This makes the advocates of openness concerned to see it develop in a publicly
                beneficially manner. However, what that looks like remains unclear.
